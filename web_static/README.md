# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static

## Description

Now that you have a command interpreter for managing your AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, we will build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything

**1. Index files**

All index.html files in this folder are one level of the web page from index.html 0 to 8.


**2. Styles folder**

All the .css stylesheets are situated in the **styles**.


**3. Images**

All the icons and logos used for this project are in the **images**.
